# ecology562
A backup of Jack Wiess's "Statistics for Environmental Science" course

Course url: https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/2842013b-58f5-4453-aa8d-3e01bacbfc3d/public/Ecol562_Spring2012/index.html

This repo is intended as a backup if UNC ever decides to take Jack's course offline

I created this snapshot with the follwing command
`wget -r --level=2 -k -p https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/2842013b-58f5-4453-aa8d-3e01bacbfc3d/public/Ecol562_Spring2012/index.html`
