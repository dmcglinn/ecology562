<h2>Due Date </h2>

  <p>Monday, April 30, 2012</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p align="left">Same rules and policies apply to this &quot;exam&quot; as apply to ordinary assignments. </p>
<h2>Data Source </h2>

  <p>The file <a href="../../data/fish.txt">fish.txt</a> contains the data for this assignment. This is a tab-delimited text file in which the variable names appear in the first row.</p>
  <h2>Background </h2>
  <p>An experiment was carried out to compare the behavior of a native Caribbean   fish species <em>Haemulon plumieri</em>  to different native fish species (mostly natural predators) with its behavior to an invasive predator (lionfish). Three individuals of <em>Haemulon plumieri </em>were placed in a cage and a &quot;treatment&quot; predator was placed in an adjacent cage. The three &quot;prey&quot; fish were videotaped and twelve  pictures, spaced at regular time intervals, were created from the video. In each picture the positions of the three prey fish were noted relative to the predator fish. It was decided to broadly classify position into the three categories shown in the figure below: facing the predator (category 1), turned to one side (category 2), and turned away from the predator. Only in positions 1 and 2 can the prey fish see the predator in the adjacent cage.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/assignments/finalpart3/lionfish.png" width="679" height="173" alt="lionfish"></p>
  <p>It was not possible to distinguish the individual fish in the photos so no attempt was made to track individual fish over time. Instead in each  picture the three fish  were individually classified as being in one of the three different position categories.  (ambiguous cases were   assigned to the most similar category). These values were then summed over all 12 pictures to yield the total number of times  each of the three different positions occurred. This constitutes a single trial in the experiment. For most trials <em>n</em> = 36 (three fish &times; twelve pictures), but a few of the trials used only two fish yielding <em>n</em> = 24. Other random anomalies occurred so that not all totals were 36.</p>
  <p> 76 trials were conducted over 14 days divided unequally among eight different predator treatments. The hope was that the typical position assumed by the prey fish would indicate how scary they found a potential predator to be. It was thought  that the  position order 1, 2, 3 might correspond to decreasing scariness but this ranking was by no means certain. The treatments were coded by the type of fish used: CN (control), GR (grouper), LF (lionfish), RH (red hind), SM (schoolmaster),  SQ (squirrelfish),  YH (yellowhead), YT (yellowtail). The control (CN) was an empty predator cage. On any given day between four to seven of the treatments were administered. For all of the trials on that day the same three prey fish were reused as much as possible. Different predator and prey fish individuals were used on different days.</p>
  <p>The lionfish is a recent introduction into the Caribbean,  so native fish may not be fully accustomed to its presence and  may not  view it as very frightening. Because the focus of this study is   lionfish, lionfish should be used as the reference group for all treatment comparisons in your analysis. You should also use position 3 as the reference group for all comparisons of the three positions.</p>

<h2 align="left">Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><span class="styleArial">R coding question: </span>Using one line of R code determine how many <span class="style8">trials</span> there were for each of the eight <span class="style8">treatments</span>.</li>
  <li>Fit a model that is appropriate for assessing whether predator <span class="style8">treatment</span> had an effect on prey <span class="style8">position</span>.</li>
  <li>Carry out an appropriate goodness of fit test for your model of Question 2.</li>
  <li>To improve the fit of your model add <span class="style8">day</span> as an additional predictor to the model of Question 2 and check the fit again.</li>
  <li>Provide a possible explanation of  the persistent lack of fit by describing two characteristics of this experiment that may  violate  assumptions of the multinomial distribution. In each case clearly state the nature of the violation.</li>
  <li>Fit a quasi-Poisson distribution to the model of Question 4 as a last ditch effort to deal with the model's lack of fit.</li>
  <li>Produce a graphical summary of the results of this experiment using your quasi-Poisson model. Plot the different log odds ratios for <span class="style8">treatment</span> and <span class="style8">position</span> as a panel graph. Each panel should display all seven of the treatment comparisons. Different panels should depict different <span class="style8">position</span> comparisons. In the graph  display point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of individual log odds ratios. Also include a second set of confidence intervals that can be used to make pairwise comparisons between all the <span class="style8">treatment</span> effects that are displayed in that panel. Add a vertical line to each panel that permits testing whether each of the individual  log odds ratio is statistically significant.</li>
  <li>Repeat the graph from Question 7 but this time display odds ratios rather than log odds ratios. </li>
  <li>What are your conclusions? How scary are lionfish?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<h3><strong>Question 3</strong></h3>
<p>The saturated model for this problem fits a separate parameter for each position at each trial. To verify that your saturated model is correct you can fit the Poisson version of it and verify that the residual deviance is zero.</p>
<h3><strong>Question 4</strong></h3>
<p>Don't just blindly put <span class="style8">day</span> in the model. Think about what you're trying to accomplish here. <span class="style8">Day</span> is  a nuisance variable that you're including only because you think the   results may have changed depending on the  day of the experiment. In the language of experimental design <span class="style8">day</span> is a blocking variable in this experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>
<p>The assumptions of the multinomial distribution are the same as the assumptions of the binomial distribution.</p>
<h3><strong>Question 6</strong></h3>
<p>The null Poisson model requires that the variables <span class="style8">trial</span> and <span class="style8">position</span> be included as covariates. To add a predictor to the null model you need to add it as an  interaction with the <span class="style8">position</span> variable.</p>
<p>To make &quot;LF&quot; the reference group for <span class="style8">treatment</span> you will need to change the reference level of <span class="style8">treatment</span> using the <span class="style22">levels</span> argument of <span class="style102">factor</span>. Set 3 as the reference group of <span class="style8">position</span> for the multinomial model but not for the Poisson model. Because of the weirdness of the Poisson model we're fitting, weird because it looks like there are interactions in the model without all of the component main effects, R mixes up the order of the levels of <span class="style8">position</span> in portions of the model. (The truth is <span class="style8">trial</span> is playing the role of the main effect of the two factors <span class="style8">treatment</span> and <span class="style8">day</span> in this model, but R doesn't know that.) If you leave the levels of <span class="style8">position</span> in their default order 1, 2, 3 when you fit the <span class="style102">glm</span> model, R will estimate the 2 and 3 effects of <span class="style8">position</span> relative to 1 in the main effect terms, which we don't care about, but R will  estimate the 1 and 2 effects using 3 as the reference group in the interaction of <span class="style8">position</span> with <span class="style8">treatment</span>, which is what we want.</p>
<h3><strong>Question 7</strong></h3>
<p>When there are this many comparisons it can be difficult to find a single confidence level that works for all of them. You may need to use different confidence levels for different estimates and finding the right combination (if one exists) may be more trouble than it's worth. For this problem most of the pairwise comparisons are clearly not significant so it is doable. </p>
<p>Start with the confidence level that yields the shortest confidence intervals in each panel. Any pairwise comparison not significantly different at this setting will not be different for any other choice either. Create the graph and note whether the pair for which this is the correct setting  turn out to be significantly different. If they're not then you can use the next highest level instead. If they are significantly different it may be possible to increase the level and still have them display as being different. Note which other pairs are shown as significantly different. For each of these significant pairs change the confidence level to a value that is actually appropriate for comparing them and recreate the graph to see if they're still significant. If the pair is no longer significant you're going to need to play with the levels individually so that the pairs that should be significantly different are shown as such in the final display.</p>
