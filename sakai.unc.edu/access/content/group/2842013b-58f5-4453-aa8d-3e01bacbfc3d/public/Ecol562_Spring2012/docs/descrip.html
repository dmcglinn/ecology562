  <h3 class="style10">Overview of the Course</h3>
  <p><span class="MsoNormal">An introduction to statistical methods for ecology and environmental science. This  is a topics course. Our emphasis here is on breadth rather than depth. (The other graduate course I teach takes an in-depth approach to the topics covered in the first third of this course.) Familiarity with the standard parametric approaches of statistical analysis such as hypothesis testing is assumed. The course is intended to serve as a transition between what is typically taught in an undergraduate statistics course and what is actually needed to successfully analyze data in ecology and environmental sciences. The ideal enrollee is an upper level undergraduate  or beginning graduate student who has already taken an introductory statistics course and wishes to see the modern application of statistics to environmental science and ecology.</span></p>
<h3 class="style10">Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>The prerequisites are modest, a one semester undergraduate or high school course in statistics 
    (the equivalent of UNC Stat 31) and some exposure to the concepts of calculus. If you have never studied 
    statistics, this is probably not the course for you. Having said this I 
    think it is quite possible to obtain the requisite background through self-study 
    before the course begins. I expect you to be familiar with (as in heard of and can quickly relearn)  the following 
    concepts: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ol>
    <li>elementary probability theory including the notion of conditional probability and continuous and discrete random variables,</li>
    <li> the standard parametric approaches to hypothesis testing, e.g., one 
      and two-sample t-tests, etc., and</li>
    <li>elementary linear regression in which there is a single response and 
      a single predictor.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just about any elementary statistics text covers this material. The book 
    <i>Introduction to the Practice of Statistics</i> by David S. Moore and 
    George P. McCabe, the text that is used in undergraduate statistics courses 
    at UNC, is an adequate choice as is any other text written at this level. 
    Personal favorites of mine include <i>Statistics with Applications to the 
      Biological and Health Sciences</i> by M. Anthony Schork and Richard D. Remington 
    (any edition) and <i>Biometry</i> by Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf. 
  </p>
<h3 class="style10">Statistical Software</h3>
  <p>No familiarity with statistical software is assumed. We will be using R, 
    an implementation of the S language, available for free download at 
    <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</a>. R runs 
    on all major operating systems, including Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X. R 
    is a state-of-the-art modern statistical package actively supported by the 
    worldwide scientific community. It is not easy to use but it has become the de facto 
    standard for scientific research.  Our Friday sessions in Peabody Hall will 
    focus primarily on the use of R. </p>
<h3 class="style10">Course Content </h3>
  <p>This  course   covers a number of  statistical methods that have proven useful in analyzing environmental data. The topics this semester will include the following. </p>
